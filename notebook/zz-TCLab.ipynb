The Arduino-based device consists of a two-input, two-output system of heaters and sensors. [TCLab](https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab) is a Python library providing the software tools to create and test control algorithms ranging from simple step testing to sophisticated multivarible predictive control."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"faIPxMnExS56"},"source":["## Hardware\n","\n","This notebook provides a basic introduction to the device and the TCLab library.\n","\n","![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SizingLab/SystemsEngineeringIntroduction/main/figures/0B.99-tclab_device.png)\n","\n","The Temperature Control Laboratory hardware consists of five components:\n","\n","1.
