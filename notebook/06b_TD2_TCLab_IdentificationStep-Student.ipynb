To account for this possibility, we introduce $𝑇_𝐻$ to denote the temperature of heater one and $𝑇_𝑆$ to denote the temperature of the corresponding sensor. We'll further assume that sensor mainly exchanges heat with the heater, and the dominant heat transfer to the surroundings is through the heat sink attached to the heater.\n",
