    "\n",
    "1. **Download**:\n",
    "   - Visit the official Anaconda website: [Anaconda Downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section).\n",
    "   - Download the installer corresponding to your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Installation**:\n",
    "   - Run the downloaded installer.\n",
    "   - Follow the on-screen instructions. It is recommended to install Anaconda in user mode to avoid permission issues.\n",
    "   - The installation requires approximately 3 GB of disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration**:\n",
    "   - During installation, make sure to check the option to add Anaconda to your PATH.\n",
    "   - Once the installation is complete, restart your terminal or command prompt.\n",

    "\n",
    "To verify that the installation was successful, open a terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the version of Conda displayed, confirming that the installation was successful.\n"
