    "The NASA System Engineering Handbook [[NASA, 2017](#References)] distingues four system design processes enabling the system definition: developing stakeholder expectations, technical requirements, logical decompositions, and design solutions. These system design processes are interdependent, highly iterative and recursive processes resulting on the different systems, subsystems in a validated set of requirements and a design solution that satisfies a set of stakeholder expectations.  \n",
