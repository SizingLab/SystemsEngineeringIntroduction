    "Cubsat satellites are generally located in low earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of between 400 and 600 km.  Their speed is very high, around 27500 km/h or 450 km/min or 7.6 km/s. One rotation around the Earth takes around 90 minutes, and is usually done along an axis perpendicular to the equator. There are therefore around 16 rotations in 24 hours. Their thermal behaviour is strongly influenced by solar radiation and the [Earth's shadows](http://sesp.esep.pro/fr/pages_nanosats/index.html). \n",
