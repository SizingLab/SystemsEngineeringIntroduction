We will be looking at attitude control of a CubeSat along one axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nanosatellites, such as CubeSats, employ various technologies for attitude control. Reaction wheels and magnetorquers are common actuators, with reaction wheels providing precise control through momentum exchange and magnetorquers interacting with Earth's magnetic field for torque generation. \n",

    "![Reaction Wheel](./Image/reactionwheel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A reaction wheel consists of several key components:\n",
    "-\t**Flywheel:** A disk or wheel with significant mass, designed to spin at high speeds to generate angular momentum for controlling the satellite's orientation.\n",
    "-\t**Electric Motor:** Typically a brushless DC motor, it drives the flywheel to spin at varying speeds in response to control commands.\n",
    "-\t**Motor Controller:** An electronic circuit that regulates the motor's torque, speed and direction, allowing precise control of the flywheel's rotation.\n",
    "-\t**Sensors:** Devices such as gyrometer and magnetometer that monitor the cubesat rotational speed and position, providing feedback to the control system for precise adjustments.\n",
    "These components work together to enable the reaction wheel to effectively manage the satellite's attitude by altering its rotational velocity. "
